-> Firewalld is a type of software-based firewall freature available in Linux.
-> It works with the concept of zones which helps in segregating and simplifying the configuration.
-> One of the main adv. is we have the liberty to change rules in real time without having any sort of interuptions.
-> Also, this is protocol independent of IPv4 and IPv6
-> Each network card inside the machine is linked to one of the available zones.
-> Every available firewall-service has a seperate XML file available.
-> Almost all of these firewall-services are disabled by the firewall. Only a few which are default are added in the firewall-zones
